Installation Instructions
=========================

Obtaining the Latest Software
-----------------------------

The latest stable and development versions of ``scikits.cuda`` can be downloaded from 
`GitHub <http://github.com/lebedov/scikits.cuda>`_

Online documentation for ``scikits.cuda`` is available at 
`ReadTheDocs <http://scikitscuda.readthedocs.org/>`_

Prerequisites
-------------

``scikits.cuda`` requires that the following software packages be
installed:

* `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ 2.5 or later.
* `setuptools <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools>`_ 0.6c10 or later.
* `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ 1.2.0 or later.
* `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org>`_ 0.7.0 or later.
* `PyCUDA <http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda>`_ 0.94rc or later.
* `NIVIDIA CUDA Toolkit <http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html>`_ 3.0 or later.

Some of the linear algebra functionality relies on the CULA toolkit; the single
precision of the toolkit is free of charge, but requires registration:

* `CULA <http://www.culatools.com/get-cula/>`_ 1.3 or later.

To build the documentation, the following packages are also required:

* `Docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net>`_ 0.5 or later.
* `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_ 1.0.1 or later.
* `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org>`_ 2.2 or later.
* `Pygments <http://pygments.org>`_ 0.8 or later.

The software has been tested on Linux; it should also work on other
platforms supported by the above packages.

Building and Installation
-------------------------

``scikits.cuda`` searches for CUDA libraries in the system library
search path. You may have to modify this path (e.g., by adding the
path to the CUDA libraries to /etc/ld.so.conf or to the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environmental variable on Linux) if the libraries are
not being found.

To build and install the toolbox, download and unpack the source 
release and run::

   python setup.py install

from within the main directory in the release. To rebuild the
documentation, run::

   make

from within the ``doc/`` subdirectory and follow the directions.


Getting Started
---------------
Sample code demonstrating how to use different parts of the toolbox is
located in the ``demos/`` subdirectory. Many of the high-level
functions also contain doctests that describe their usage.
