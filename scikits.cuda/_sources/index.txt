CUDA SciKit
===========

This SciKit (toolkit for `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org>`_)
provides Python interfaces to a subset of the functions in the CUDA, CUDART,
CUBLAS, and CUFFT libraries distributed as part of `NVIDIA's CUDA Programming
Toolkit <http://www.nvidia.com/cuda>`_, as well as interfaces to select
functions in the basic and premium versions of the `CULA Toolkit <http://www.culatools.com>`_. In
contrast to most existing Python wrappers for these libraries (many of which
only provide a low-level interface to the actual library functions), this
package uses `PyCUDA <http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda/>`_ to provide
high-level functions comparable to those in the `NumPy
<http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ package.
